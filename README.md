# ILIA WEBSITE 

## IDEA:
I would love to take on the challenge of re-creating this beautiful website on both the front and back end. Ilia is a make up website where customers can brouse and purchase products, and even send in photos and a message for a personalized color match. Here is a link for reference. While this will be a project that I continue to add to, to stick to the three week time frame I plan on scaling down to include a couple less pages than the ones featured in full. Here's a link for reference!

### FEATURES:
 - Allow users to create an account and log in 
 - Allow users to browse products, add them to cart, and check out successfully. 
 - Consumers can send a message and photo attachments through the website for a product color match. 

### POTENTIAL OR FUTURE EXTRA FEATURES:
- Create a clone of the website in full, with data for all pages and items online. 
- Add a chat feature that allows users to chat with customer service on the website. 
- Allow users to post reviews on specific products, and search reviews by number of stars.
